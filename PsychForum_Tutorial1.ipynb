Since the images of CIFAR10 are only 32x32x3, the network to classify them cannot be too deep (remember the effect of convolution and pooling operations). For that reason, the authors of Resnet made a mini-version tailored to CIFAR10. The most important differences to the Resnet-version used on Imagenet (224x224x3 images) is the amount of blocks and the depth of the filters. Also, to somewhat reduce the performance we have made the network slightly smaller. \n",

        "ANSWER: Based on the comparison, the fixed training schedule seemed to have worked best. This is likely due to the fact that this schedule had a late phase with a very small learing rate, which allowed for very fine adjustments and that this was lacking in the other trainings. Also, this fixed schedule was based on the data-set making it a hyper parameter that has been optimized. "
